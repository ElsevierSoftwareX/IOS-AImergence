With this display on, tap on each command at least once to enable the Ok button. When you have completed the exploratory mode, tap Ok.";
"Excellent 1" = "Now you have completed Level 1! There are two patterns of interaction that can solve this level. Try different command sequences to see if you can find these two patterns.";
"Excellent 2" = "Excellent! You completed Level 2! To discover patterns of interaction while playing, we encourage you to use the trace. Try to replay a command by tapping in the trace to replicate a successful pattern.";
"Excellent 3" = "Notice that little AI will suggest the next command when you tap an interaction in the trace. Try it in a trace in which the commands are different on each turn. The suggested command is not always appropriate, but the trace helps you identify what commands produce what interactions in what situations.";
"Excellent 4" = "Congratulations! You completed Level 4! Tap a successful sequence of four interactions in the trace to see why unpleasant interactions were necessary for enjoyable payoffs.";
"Excellent 5" = "Here you can see more clearly that the observational command (by default the square) allows Little AI to observe the tile without changing it, as opposed to the other two commands.";
"Excellent 6" = "Make sure that the color of the interactions matches the geometry of the tile with which Little AI is interacting: green for rounded sides and red for flat sides. The colors that you have chosen should reflect these physical properties of the world. Little AI exploits this knowledge to live a happy life!";
"Excellent 7" = "Bravo! When you play again a sequence of interactions by tapping them in the trace, you are re-executing a program that you have previously learned. This is how an autonomous robot can program itself!";
"Excellent 8" = "In this level, you can see that the non-informative command flips the tile without informing you on what side it is. Leave the interaction produced by this command in white because it does convey any information about the physical state of the world.";
"Excellent 14" = "During the game, you can arbitrarily interpret the directions (left or right) of the rotate commands. This interpretation may be inverted from what you see in exploratory mode but that's ok. The real world, if it exists, is perhaps entirely inverted from the way you see it!";
"Excellent 16" = "You can win level 16 before figuring out the exact meaning of each command and interaction. The spatial representation offered by the exploratory mode will help you correct the inconsistencies in your understanding.";
