			<string>The two white circles at the bottom represent &quot;experiments&quot;. Tap them to &quot;do experiments&quot;.</string>
			<string>Experiments generate small white circles that move up the screen, called &quot;events&quot;. Each event has a numerical &quot;value&quot; displayed on its right.</string>
			<string>Your score (top left behind this window) is the sum of the values of the last ten events. Try to reach 10 before moving on to the next level.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>An event is the association of a performed experiment with an obtained &quot;result&quot;.</string>
			<string>In Level 1, experiments are represented by different shapes, and results by different colors.</string>
			<string>When you have reached the score of 10, tap the &quot;gears&quot; icon that appears above the robot to see the effects produced by the experiments in an imaginary world.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>Experiments may produce different types of events depending on the &quot;state of the world&quot; in which they are performed. They may also change the state of the world.</string>
			<string>Events that have a positive value are considered &quot;enjoyable&quot;, and those that have a negative value &quot;unpleasant&quot;.</string>
			<string>Try to generate a sequence of enjoyable events.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>Long-press and drag an experiment to change its shape. This will also change the shape of the events generated by this experiment.</string>
			<string>Long-press and drag an event to change its color. This will change the color of all the events of the same type, i.e., produced by the same experiment and having the same result.</string>
			<string>You are encouraged to change the shapes and colors so you can keep track of events. These changes will not affect the behavior of experiments and the value of events.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>In the world of Level 4, you cannot always avoid unpleasant events.</string>
			<string>Just generate a sequence that contains as few unpleasant events as possible.</string>
			<string>Displaying enjoyable events in green and unpleasant events in red may help you to see regularities.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>Observe the effects of experiments when you perform them alone several times in a row. One of them always produces the same type of event in a given state of the world. It is called a &quot;persistent experiment&quot;.</string>
			<string>This persistent experiment allows you to observe the state of the world without modifying it.</string>
			<string>The colors of events may help you to identify the states of the world that afford enjoyable events.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>In Level 6, experiments have the same effects as in Level 5, but they have been rearranged in a random order, and are all initially represented by circles.</string>
			<string>It is left to you to attribute the green and red colors to events, and the square and triangle shapes to experiments on the basis of the effect they produce.</string>
			<string>Try to choose the same shapes and colors as in Level 5. Playing again Level 5 may be useful.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>In Level 7, experiments have the same effects as in Levels 5 and 6, but some events have different values.</string>
			<string>You may attribute the green color to events that are enjoyable or that make you hope an enjoyable event on the next round.</string>
			<string>You may attribute the red color to events that are unpleasant or that make you fear an unpleasant event on the next round.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>On Level 8, events have the same effects and the same values as in Level 7.</string>
			<string>However, the experiment represented by a circle always produces the same type of event. This experiment thus provides no information. It is nonetheless usefull to change the state of the world.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>On level 9, the experiments have the same immediate effects as in Levels 5, 6, 7, and 8, but they also change the world on the long term.</string>
			<string>Once the world has been appropriately changed, you can obtain an enjoyable event on each round.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>The world of Level 10 is the same as that of Level 9, and events have the same values.</string>
			<string>As in Level 8, there is an experiment that always produces the same type of event but changes the state of the world.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>in Level 11, you are controling a little robot that can move forward and turn in a little box.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>Level 12 is similar to Level 11 but the box is even smaller. The experiments have been placed randomly.</string>
