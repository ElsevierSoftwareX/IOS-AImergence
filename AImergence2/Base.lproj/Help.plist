			<string>Welcome to Little AI!</string>
			<string>With the buttons at the bottom of the screen, you are controlling a baby robot. The goal is to reach the score of 10 within 10 turns.</string>
			<string>As you control the robot, it carries out &quot;interactions&quot; with its environment represented by colored circles and squares. After having reached the score of 10, you will be able to see what the interactions correspond to in an exploratory mode.</string>
			<string>The score is the sum of the values of the last ten interactions. Yes, only the last ten!</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>An interaction is the association of a command with feedback information. Commands are represented by different shapes and feedback information by different colors. The stream of interactions is called the &quot;trace&quot;.</string>
			<string>To complete each level, reach the score of 10 within the last ten turns. Next, press the buttons that pop up:  the &quot;gears&quot; to enter exploratory mode, and the &quot;podium&quot; to see the leaderboard. </string>
			<string>Drag the 2D robot to the right or to the left to shift to the previous or to the next level.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>Your baby robot finds some interactions enjoyable and some unpleasant; positive and negative values indicate enjoyable and unpleasant interactions, with higher values indicating greater levels of each.</string>
			<string>Generate a pattern of enjoyable interactions.</string>
			<string>Tap an interaction in the trace to replay a previous command. The same command replayed in the same situation yields the same interaction. To replay an entire pattern of interactions, tap the &quot;next command&quot; several times (white shape that appears on the left when you tap an interaction).</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>Press and hold a command to change its shape. Press and hold an interaction in the trace to change its color.</string>
			<string>Change the shapes of the commands and the colors of interactions to recognize them. Shapes and colors are purely descriptive. They do not change the robot.</string>
			<string>You can also recognize interactions by the cries your baby robot makes. In this game, your ears can also help you!</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>In Level 4, your robot cannot always avoid unpleasant interactions.</string>
			<string>Generate a pattern of interaction that contains as few unpleasant interactions as possible. </string>
			<string>Use different shapes for the commands. Display the enjoyable interactions in green and the unpleasant interactions in red. Don&apos;t think too much, your brain will see the pattern before you know it!</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>Experiment with each command individually several times in a row. In the trace, you will see that one command aways yields the same interaction within a given situation (same shape and same color).</string>
			<string>This command allows you to observe the world without changing it. We call this command a &quot;persistent&quot; command, and the resulting interaction an &quot;observational interaction&quot;.</string>
			<string>Use the colors of interactions to identify the situations that afford enjoyable interactions.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>In Level 6, the commands have the same effects as in Level 5, but they have been rearranged in a random order, and are all initially represented by circles.</string>
			<string>It is left to you to attribute shapes to commands and colors to interactions.</string>
			<string>Display the interactions that make you hope for an enjoyable interaction on the next round in green, and those that let you fear for an unpleasant interaction in red.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>In Level 7, the commands have the same effects as in Levels 5 and 6, but the values of interactions are different.</string>
			<string>Tap the interactions to replay enjoyable patterns of intreaction in the context when it is possible.</string>
			<string>When you replay a pattern, skip the observational interactions to maximize your score.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>On Level 8, the commands have the same effects as in Levels 5 to 7.</string>
			<string>Now, however, one of the commands always yields the same interaction. This is a &quot;non-informative command&quot;.</string>
			<string>Although non-informative commands always yield the same interaction, do not mistake them for persistent commands.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>On level 9, the commands have the same immediate effects as in Levels 5, 6, 7, and 8, but they also transform the environment on the long term.</string>
			<string>Your baby robot must transform its environment until it can enact an enjoyable interaction on every move.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>Level 10&apos;s world is similar to Level 9&apos;s, and interactions have the same values.</string>
			<string>As in Level 8, one of the commands always yields the same interaction (non-informative command).</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>Your baby robot can move forward and turn in a little box.</string>
			<string>It loves moving forward but hates bumping into the edges of the box.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>The box is even smaller.</string>
			<string>Scroll to review the last 100 interactions. Double-tap on an empty area to scroll back to origin.</string>
			<string>Press the score to see your number of moves.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>Level 13 offers the same commands as Levels 11 and 12 plus a persistent command that allows your robot to observe its situation without modifying it (observational interaction).</string>
			<string>This baby robot hates bumping, and quite dislikes turning. Fortunately, the box is getting bigger!</string>
			<string>Use the observational interactions produced by the persistent command to avoid bumping into the edges.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>Level 14&apos;s world is the same as Level 13&apos;s.</string>
			<string>As a player, you are in an analogous situation as a newborn baby that ignores the signification of its gestures and of its senses, or of a robot that ignores the signification of its actuators and sensors.</string>
			<string>You must learn to know yourself and your environment to live a happy life!</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>Your baby robot has two additional persistent commands that it can use to observe the edges of the box on its right and on its left.</string>
			<string>Use the possibilities of observation offered by these commands to avoid turning towards the edges of the box.</string>
			<string>The box is getting even bigger.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>You are in the same world as in Level 15 with the same commands initially uninterpreted.</string>
