			<string>The two white circles at the bottom represent &quot;experiments&quot;. Tap them to &quot;do experiments&quot;.</string>
			<string>Experiments generate small white circles that move up the screen, called &quot;experiences&quot;. Each experience has a numerical &quot;value&quot; displayed on its right.</string>
			<string>Your score (top left behind this window) is the sum of the values of your last ten experiences. Try to reach 10 before moving on to the next level.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>An experience is the association of a performed experiment with an obtained &quot;result&quot;.</string>
			<string>In Level 1, experiments are represented by different shapes, and results by different colors.</string>
			<string>When you have reached the score of 10, tap the &quot;cloud&quot; icon that appears above the robot to see the effects produced by the experiments in an imaginary world.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>Experiments may produce different experiences depending on the &quot;state of the world&quot; in which they are performed. They may also change the state of the world.</string>
			<string>Experiences that have a positive value are considered &quot;enjoyable&quot;, and those that have a negative value &quot;unpleasant&quot;.</string>
			<string>Try to generate a sequence of enjoyable experiences.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>Long-press an experiment to change its shape. This will also change the shape of the experiences generated by this experiment.</string>
			<string>Long-press an experience to change its color. This will also change the color of the other experiences produced by the same experiment and having the same result.</string>
			<string>Shapes and colors are purely illustrative. Changing them will not affect the behavior of experiments and the value of experiences.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>In the world of Level 4, you cannot always avoid unpleasant experiences.</string>
			<string>Just generate a sequence that contains as few unpleasant experiences as possible.</string>
			<string>Displaying enjoyable experiences in green and unpleasant experiences in red may help you to see regularities.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>Observe the effects of experiments when you try to use them alone several times in a row. One of them always produces the same experiences in a given state of the world. It is called a &quot;persistent experiment&quot;.</string>
			<string>This persistent experiment allows you to observe the state of the world without modifying it.</string>
			<string>The colors of experiences may help you to identify the states of the world that afford enjoyable experiences.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>In Level 6, experiments have the same effects as in Level 5, but they have been rearranged in a random order, and are all initially represented by circles.</string>
			<string>It is left to you to attribute the green and red colors to experiences, and the square and triangle shapes to experiments on the basis of the effect they produce.</string>
			<string>Try to choose the same shapes and colors as in Level 5. Playing again Level 5 may be useful.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>In Level 7, experiments have the same effects as in Levels 5 and 6, but some experiences have different values.</string>
			<string>You may attribute the green color to experiences that are enjoyable or that make you hope an enjoyable experience on the next round.</string>
			<string>You may attribute the red color to experiences that are unpleasant or that make you fear an unpleasant experience on the next round.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>On Level 8, experiences have the same effects and the same values as in Level 7.</string>
			<string>However, the experiment represented by a circle always produces the same experience. This experiment thus provides no unformation. It is nonetheless usefull to change the state of the world.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>On level 9, the experiments have the same immediate effects as in Levels 5, 6, 7, and 8, but they also change the world on the long term.</string>
			<string>Once the world has been appropriately changed, you can obtain an enjoyable experience on each round.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>The world of Level 10 is the same as that of Level 9, and experiences have the same values.</string>
			<string>As in Level 8, there is an experiment that always produces the same experience but changes the state of the world.</string>
