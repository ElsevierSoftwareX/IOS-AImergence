			<string>Welcome to Little AI!</string>
			<string>With the buttons at the bottom of the screen, you are controlling a baby robot. The goal is to reach the score of 10.</string>
			<string>As you control the robot, it carries out &quot;interactions&quot; with its environment represented by the little circles that move up the screen. You can see what the interactions correspond to after having reached the score of 10.</string>
			<string>The score is the sum of the values of the last ten interactions. Yes, only the last ten!</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>An interaction is the association of a command with a feedback information. Commands are represented by different shapes and feedback information by different colors.</string>
			<string>On each level, reach the score of 10. Next, press the buttons that pop up:  the &quot;gears&quot; to watch the effects of the commands, and the &quot;podium&quot; to see the leaderboard. </string>
			<string>Drag the 2D robot to the right or to the left to shift to the previous or to the next level.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>Imagine that your baby robot finds the interactions that have a positive value enjoyable, and those that have a negative value unpleasant.</string>
			<string>Generate a pattern of enjoyable interactions.</string>
			<string>Tap an interaction to replay the same command. The same command replayed in the same situation yields the same interaction. To replay an entire pattern of interactions, tap the &quot;next command&quot; several times (white shape that appears on the left when you tap an interaction).</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>Press and hold a command to change its shape. Press and hold an interaction to change its color.</string>
			<string>Change the shapes of commands and the colors of interactions to recognize them. Shapes and colors are purely descriptive. They do not change the robot.</string>
			<string>You can also recognize interactions by the cries of your baby robot. In this game, your ears can also help you!</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>In the world of Level 4, your robot cannot always avoid unpleasant interactions.</string>
			<string>Generate a pattern of interaction that contains as few unpleasant interactions as possible. </string>
			<string>Use different shapes for the commands. Display the enjoyable interactions in green and the unpleasant interactions in red. Don&apos;t think too much, your brain will see the pattern before you know it!</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>Experiment with each command individually several times in a raw. One of the commands always yields the same interaction in a given situation. It is a &quot;persistent&quot; command.</string>
			<string>The persistent command produces an &quot;observational interaction&quot; that allows your robot to observe its situation without modifying it.</string>
			<string>Use the colors of interactions to identify the situations that afford enjoyable interactions.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>In Level 6, the commands have the same effects as in Level 5, but they have been rearranged in a random order, and are all initially represented by circles.</string>
			<string>It is left to you to attribute shapes to commands and colors to interactions.</string>
			<string>Display the interactions that make you hope for an enjoyable interaction on the next round in green, and those that let you fear for an unpleasant interaction in red.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>In Level 7, the commands have the same effects as in Levels 5 and 6, but the values of interactions are different.</string>
			<string>Tap the interactions to replay enjoyable patterns of intreaction in the context when it is possible.</string>
			<string>When you replay a pattern, skip the observational interactions to maximize your score.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>On Level 8, the commands have the same effects as in Levels 5 to 7.</string>
			<string>Now, however, one of the commands always yields the same interaction. This is a &quot;non-informative command&quot;.</string>
			<string>Although non-informative commands always yield the same interaction, do not mistake them for persistent commands.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>On level 9, the commands have the same immediate effects as in Levels 5, 6, 7, and 8, but they also transform the environment on the long term.</string>
			<string>Your baby robot must transform its environment until it can enact an enjoyable interaction on every move.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>Level 10&apos;s world is similar to Level 9&apos;s, and interactions have the same values.</string>
			<string>As in Level 8, one of the commands always yields the same interaction (non-informative command).</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>Your baby robot can move forward and turn in a little box.</string>
			<string>It loves moving forward but hates bumping into the edges of the box.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>The box is even smaller.</string>
			<string>Scroll to review the last 100 interactions. Double-tap on an empty area to scroll back to origin.</string>
			<string>Press the score to see your number of moves.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>Level 13 offers the same commands as Levels 11 and 12 plus a persistent command that allows your robot to observe its situation without modifying it (observational interaction).</string>
			<string>This baby robot hates bumping, and quite dislikes turning. Fortunately, the box is getting bigger!</string>
			<string>Use the observational interactions produced by the persistent command to avoid bumping into the edges.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>Level 14&apos;s world is the same as Level 13&apos;s.</string>
			<string>As a player, you are in an analogous situation as a newborn baby that ignores the signification of its gestures and of its senses, or of a robot that ignores the signification of its actuators and sensors.</string>
			<string>You must learn to know yourself and your environment to live a happy life!</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>Your baby robot has two additional persistent commands that it can use to observe the edges of the box on its right and on its left.</string>
			<string>Use the possibilities of observation offered by these commands to avoid turning towards the edges of the box.</string>
			<string>The box is getting even bigger.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>You are in the same world as in Level 15 with the same commands initially uninterpreted.</string>
			<string>Little AI is a free open-source research and pedagogical project driven by enthousiast volunteers in collaboration with academia.</string>

			<string>You reached the last level ! Congratulations! It is similar to Level 16.</string>
			<string>If you found Little AI enjoyable or instructive, or both, please consider making a small donation.</string>
			<string>Your donations will help us create more levels. They will also support independant and open-source research in developmental artificial intelligence.</string>
